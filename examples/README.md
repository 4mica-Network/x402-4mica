# x402-4mica Examples

Quick-start references that follow the standard x402 flow: the client only talks to the resource server, while the server calls the facilitator for `/tabs`, `/verify`, and `/settle`. Users never interact with the facilitator or 4mica Core directly.

## Layout

- `server/` – mock FastAPI paywall that issues requirements and settles payments.
- `rust_client/` – Rust helper that discovers requirements, signs headers, and retries the resource.
- `python_client/` – Python helper that mirrors the Rust flow using the SDK.

## Server-driven mock paid API (`mock_paid_api.py`)

A minimal FastAPI server that returns `402 Payment Required`, issues payment requirements via `/tab`, and calls the facilitator to verify **and settle** X-PAYMENT headers on behalf of the user.

Setup:

```
cd examples/server
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure via environment or `examples/.env` (required: `RECIPIENT_ADDRESS`; optional: `FACILITATOR_URL`, `ASSET_ADDRESS`, `X402_SCHEME`, `X402_NETWORK`, `MAX_AMOUNT_WEI`, `TAB_TTL_SECONDS`, `ERC20_TOKEN`).

Run the server:

```
uvicorn mock_paid_api:app --reload --port 9000 --factory
```

Flow to exercise end-to-end:

- GET `/protected` without X-PAYMENT to receive a 402 with `paymentRequirements` and `tabEndpoint` `/tab`.
- POST `/tab` with `{ "userAddress": "<wallet>" }`; the server calls the facilitator `/tabs` and returns concrete `paymentRequirements` for that wallet.
- Sign the requirements with your wallet to produce `X-PAYMENT` (no facilitator calls from the client).
- Retry GET `/protected` with `X-PAYMENT: <header>`; the server calls the facilitator `/verify` **and** `/settle` and returns the paid content plus the facilitator responses.

## Rust helper (`examples/rust_client`)

An optional diagnostics tool for operators to prepare headers with `rust-sdk-4mica` (not part of the user-facing x402 flow). It discovers requirements, requests tabs, signs the X-PAYMENT header and retries the resource request with the payment header.

Environment variables (loaded from `examples/.env` and then `.env`):

```
PAYER_KEY=0x...           # payer's private key used to sign the guarantee
USER_ADDRESS=0x...        # payer's address to place in the guarantee claims
RESOURCE_URL=http://localhost:9000/protected
ASSET_ADDRESS=0x...       # asset used for tab funding and guarantees
```

Run from the repo root for debugging:

```
cargo run --example rust_client
```

## Python helper (`examples/python_client`)

Matches the Rust helper using the asyncio Python SDK (`fourmica_sdk`). Install dependencies in a virtualenv:

```
cd examples/python_client
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Environment variables (loaded from `examples/.env` and then `.env`):

```
PAYER_KEY=0x...           # payer's private key used to sign the guarantee
USER_ADDRESS=0x...        # payer's address to place in the guarantee claims
RESOURCE_URL=http://localhost:9000/protected
ASSET_ADDRESS=0x...       # optional sanity check for claims.asset_address
```

Run from the repo root or inside `examples/python_client`:

```
python examples/python_client/client.py
```
